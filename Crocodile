    <h1>The Street of Crocodiles</h1>
    <p><strong>Bruno Schultz</strong></p>

    <h2>Luminous Mornings</h2>
    <p>On those luminous mornings Adela returned from the market...</p>

    <p>The dark second-floor apartment of the house in Market Square was shot through each day...</p>

    <p>"On Saturday afternoons I used to go for a walk with my mother...</p>

    <h2>The Market Square</h2>
    <p>Market Square was empty and white-hot, swept by hot winds like a biblical desert...</p>

    <p>Now the windows, blinded by the glare of the empty square, had fallen asleep; the balconies declared their emptiness to heaven...</p>

    <p>A bunch of ragamuffins, sheltering in a corner of the square from the flaming broom of the heat...</p>

    <p>Thus my mother and I ambled along the two sunny sides of Market Square, guiding our broken shadows along the houses as over a keyboard...</p>

    <h2>Stryjska Street</h2>
    <p>And finally on the corner of Stryjska Street we passed within the shadow of the chemist's shop...</p>

    <p>A large jar of raspberry juice in the wide window symbolized the coolness of balms which can relieve all kinds of pain...</p>

    <p>After we passed a few more houses, the street ceased to maintain any pretense of urbanity...</p>

    <p>The suburban houses were sinking, windows and all, into the exuberant tangle of blossom in their little gardens...</p>

    <p>Overlooked by the light of day, weeds and wild flowers of all kinds luxuriated quietly...</p>

    <p>An enormous sunflower, lifted on a powerful stem and suffering from hypertrophy, clad in the yellow mourning of the last sorrowful days of its life...</p>

    <p>But the na√Øve, suburban bluebells and unpretentious dimity flowers stood helpless in their starched pink and white shifts, indifferent to the sunflower's tragedy.</p>
